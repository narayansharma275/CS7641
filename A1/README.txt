Setup and Installation Instructions

To properly set up your environment and run the projects, please follow the instructions below:

 Step 1: Install Python 3.9

Create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for the projects separately from your global Python environment. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

 Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

For mac or linux users:

source myenv/bin/activate
```

 Step 4: Install Required Dependencies
